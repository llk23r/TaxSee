### ü§î Key Design Decisions

1. **Vector Search Implementation**
   - Chose FAISS over Milvus (tried but didn't like)
     * Better performance at scale
     * Memory efficiency
     * Cosine similarity support
   
2. **Graph Database Choice**
   - Selected Neo4j for:
     * Native graph operations
     * Relationship modeling
     * Query flexibility

3. **Re-ranking Strategy**
   - Implemented cross-encoder because:
     * Higher accuracy than bi-encoders
     * Better semantic understanding
     * Worth the computational trade-off

4. **Processing Architecture**
   - Parallel processing with:
     * Process-based parallelism for CPU tasks
     * Thread-based for I/O operations
     * Dynamic batch sizing
